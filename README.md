# DAG-pc.stable-R

This research explores the application of Directed Acyclic Graphs
(DAGs) within the Human System Risk Board (HSRB) framework to
enhance astronaut mission outcomes. By leveraging DAGs to construct
knowledge graphs for 30 human system risks tracked by NASA, the HSRB
aims to foster a shared understanding of causal relationships, promoting
improved insights and communication among stakeholders. The study
also delves into the PC Algorithmâ€™s use in causal inference, employing
it to uncover causal structures in diverse datasets related to spaceflight
conditions. Data preprocessing efforts aimed to maintain data integrity,
with detailed descriptions of datasets, such as OSD-489, OSD-351, OSD-
477, OSD-608, and OSD-366, included. Results and discussions address
unexpected outcomes, the impact of dataset size, complexities in problem
representation, algorithm selection, and noise mitigation. Despite chal-
lenges, this research emphasizes the importance of continual refinement in
methodologies and data resources. Through perseverance, these findings
contribute to the field of data analysis and machine learning, informing
future research efforts.
